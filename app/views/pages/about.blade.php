				<h2>About Cookie Jar</h2>
				<p>Cookie Jar is a collaboration platform for students that allows young creatives to get in touch with one another.</p>

				<p>We believe that meeting new people, doing collaborations and helping each other makes the world better. Above that we think that it should be totally free. That's why we created Cookie Jar, the place where creators and makers can find passionate young professionals and learn together! Life is a journey and it's much more fun when we have friends and like-minded persons around us</p>

				<p>We always want to hear your collaboration stories, so feel free to contact us!</p>
