				<h2>Story: Barbara the photoqueen</h2>
				<p>I've meet Barbara accidently when I needed three girls for my photoshoot in the woods. I've only find two models and girls said they new someone. And they called Barbara.</p>

				<p>Barbara was amaizing: she posed and stood in froont of the camera as ahe was doing it for years. I've made really good pictures! After photoshooting in cold and rainy woods we were hungry and went to my place. I've asked what Barbara was studying and it was not modelling but photography! The passion she talked about it is just amazing!</p>

				<p>Next week we've had a photography workshop and I got a film camera to shoot pictures. I called Barbara and we went to the harbor to do some shooting. It was really funny and I've learned a lot! After that she had to finish her project and we went to the Academy (you know, that place in Antwerpen, where Van Gogh studied?). She did her project, I was having fun with my analogue photocamera and lights.</p>

				<p>So, when time came, I've asked Barbara if she want to help me. She took it very responsible and we went to different locations and spent quite a lot of time making these pictures. And all the time it was something: bike tire was flat, rain or people asking what we are up to and we were having fun with that. This was an amazing experience! I hope you meet someone similar to you too and it will boost your creativity!
