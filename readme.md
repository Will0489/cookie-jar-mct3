##Information

Cookie Jar is a web application and collaboration platform designed for and maintained by students. It connects students with each other to allow them to get together and work on projects.

The intention behind the platform is to bring students together when they're looking for collaborators but don't know anyone in their close vicinity or study orientation.

Cookie Jar acts as the middle man, allowing one student to put up a request for a project, while others can respond to this and offer their assistance.

## Created using the Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
